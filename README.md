-  local 1 player + computer   (GUI)
-  local 2 player on 1 screen  (GUI)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
After downloading the folder of a project you can compile any version of a project you want through terminal via *javac* (Note that javac should be installed in your machine):
```
	javac *.java
```
Java executable .class files will be generated. Then you can run it using *java* command (Be sure that java is also installed into your machine):
```
	java BattleShip
```
in case of GUI version or
```
	java Main
```
in case of console versions.
If you have downloaded some version of project via release in github, again perform previous steps.
For sake of simplicity, it would be better to have some application like eclipse downloaded to your computer in order not to perform the previously shown steps.
	

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
